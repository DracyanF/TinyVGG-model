# TinyVGG model 
- Recreated the TinyVGG deep learning architecture using PyTorch and torchvision to perform image classification on the FashionMNIST dataset. Designed and implemented a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) consisting of Conv2d, ReLU, and MaxPool2d layers to extract hierarchical visual features. 

- Trained and optimized the model using GPU (cuda) acceleration, achieving 90% accuracy on test data. hands-on experience with model architecture design, data augmentation using transforms, data loading, device management, evaluation metrics, and end-to-end computer vision workflows.
